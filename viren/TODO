ISSUES:

- rename only files whose names were changed, instead of moving everything
  to a tempdir and back
- if a mv fails, continue gracefully; don't leave the system half-baked


FUTURE IDEAS:

- allow passing sorting options like for ls
- let the user reorder files inside vim (sth like old_name -> new_name)
